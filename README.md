# Deep Thoughts
Deep Thoughts is a social media app where users can create thoughts, add reactions to other users' thoughts, and add other users to their friend list. Users can also view their own profile with their thoughts listed out, or view other users' profiles with all of their thoughts listed.

This is a full-stack MERN app using a GraphQL API and Apollo Server for interaction with the database. React was used on the front-end and MongoDB, Mongoose, Express and Node.js on the backend. GraphQL queries and mutations were used to request data and post data.
